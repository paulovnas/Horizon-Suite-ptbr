**Horizon Suite** is a core addon with pluggable modules: **Focus** (objective tracker) and **Presence** (zone text & notifications). Designed for the Midnight era—clean, cinematic, player-in-control. It replaces static, cluttered lists with a fluid interface that grants you total agency over your goals. Additional suites will appear as modules in the same options panel.

## 🎯 Focus (Objective Tracker)

![Focus - Objective Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crystilac93/Horizon-Suite/main/docs/Focus.png)

- **Smart zone tracking** – Nearby quests float to the top; list updates as you move. Delves, scenarios, and world events get their own sections with progress bars and timers.
- **Track what matters** – Achievements, Endeavors (housing), and Decor appear in the tracker. One-click to open achievement panel, housing dashboard, or decor catalog.
- **Rare boss alerts** – Super-track nearby rares with one click and optional audio alerts.
- **Live quest sync** – World quests, dailies, and weeklies update dynamically. Quests auto-track when you accept them.
- **All The Things integration** – Collection data appears directly in your objectives.
- **Combat-ready** – Hide in combat, show or hide in dungeons/raids/BGs, compact or super-minimal layouts.
- **Mythic+ and Delves** – Banner for keystone info, timer, and affixes. Delve objectives in the standard layout.

## 🎬 Presence (Zone Text & Notifications) - BETA

![Presence - Zone Text & Notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crystilac93/Horizon-Suite/main/docs/Presence.png)

- **Cinematic notifications** – Zone text, subzone changes, "Discovered" lines. Level-up, boss emotes, achievements, quest accept/complete, scenario start, and objective progress in delves/scenarios appear as styled toasts with smooth animations.

## 🎨 Visuals & UI Design

- **High-fidelity icons** – Distinct icons for Campaign, Legendary, and World Quests.
- **Customizable colours** – Per-category colour control (title, objective, zone, section).
- **Typography and spacing** – Fonts, sizes, outlines, and spacing sliders. Turn-in highlights and progress counts (e.g. 15/18) at a glance.
- **Fluid motion** – Smooth entry/exit animations and a subtle pulse on objective completion.
