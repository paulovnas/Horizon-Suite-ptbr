# Unreleased changes (legacy — pre-GitHub Issues)

These entries were captured during the transition from `pipeline.md` to GitHub Issues. The release rule includes them in the next changelog and clears this file. Section headers match CHANGELOG format.

## Fixes

- Fixed reordering of organization categories: drop target now matches cursor; auto-scroll direction when dragging near top or bottom corrected.

## New Features

- (Focus) In-zone world quests, weeklies & dailies: shown when in zone; right-click untracks and hides until zone change (not subzone). Option to show `**` suffix for in-zone but not in log (Display → List).

## Improvements

- (Focus) Tracked world quests and in-log weeklies/dailies sort to the top of their section.
- (Focus) Promotion animation: only the promoted quest fades out then fades in at the top; fixed blank space until next event.
- (Focus) Right-click on world quests untracks only (no abandon popup); Ctrl+right-click still abandons.
