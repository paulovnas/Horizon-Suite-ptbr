# Release Workflow

When the user asks to release, do a version bump, or says "release vX.Y.Z" or similar:

1. **Changelog** — Add a new `## [X.Y.Z]` section to CHANGELOG.md using entries from pipeline.md (Changelog section). Group into New Features, Improvements, Fixes.
2. **TOC** — Update `HorizonSuite.toc` `## Version:` to the new version.
3. **Clear pipeline** — Clear the Changelog section in pipeline.md so the next release does not re-add the same entries.
4. **Git** — Stage relevant files, commit with message like "vX.Y.Z - summary", push to main, create and push tag `vX.Y.Z`.
