**Horizon Suite** is a core addon with pluggable modules: **Focus** (objective tracker), **Presence** (zone text & notifications), **Insight** (cinematic tooltips), **Vista** (minimap), and **Yield** (loot toasts). Designed for the Midnight era—clean, cinematic, player-in-control. It replaces static, cluttered lists with a fluid interface that grants you total agency over your goals. Additional suites will appear as modules in the same options panel.

## 🎯 Focus (Objective Tracker)

![Focus - Objective Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crystilac93/Horizon-Suite/main/docs/Focus.png)

- **Smart zone tracking** – Nearby quests float to the top; list updates as you move. Delves, scenarios, raids, and world events get their own sections with progress bars and timers.
- **Track what matters** – Achievements, Endeavors (housing), Decor, and Traveler's Log objectives appear in the tracker. Full achievement progress tracking with criteria parsing and quantity strings. One-click to open achievement panel, housing dashboard, decor catalog, or Adventure Guide.
- **Rare boss alerts** – Super-track nearby rares with one click and optional audio alerts.
- **Live quest sync** – World quests, dailies, and weeklies update dynamically. Quests auto-track when you accept them. Choose a radar icon for auto-tracked in-zone entries.
- **All The Things integration** – Collection data appears directly in your objectives.
- **Profiles** – Create, switch, copy, and delete named profiles. Per-character, per-specialization, or global (account-wide) modes. Import and export profiles as shareable text strings.
- **Combat-ready** – Show, fade, or hide in combat; show or hide in dungeons/raids/BGs; compact or super-minimal layouts.
- **Show only on mouseover** – Fade the tracker when not hovering; move the mouse over it to reveal.
- **Mythic+ and Delves** – Banner for keystone info, timer, and affixes. Delve objectives in the standard layout.

## 🎬 Presence (Zone Text & Notifications)

![Presence - Zone Text & Notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crystilac93/Horizon-Suite/main/docs/Presence.png)

- **Cinematic notifications** – Zone text, subzone changes, "Discovered" lines. Level-up, boss emotes, achievements, quest accept/complete, scenario start, and objective progress in delves/scenarios appear as styled toasts with smooth animations.

## 💎 Yield (Loot Toasts) - BETA

- **Cinematic loot notifications** – Items, money, currency, and reputation gains appear as styled toasts with quality-based colours and smooth slide-in animations.
- **Epic and legendary flair** – Extra entrance time, shine effects, and optional sounds for high-value loot.

## 🔍 Insight (Tooltips) - BETA

- **Cinematic tooltips** – Dark backdrop, class-colored player names and borders, faction icons, spec/role display, and fade-in animation.
- **Profile-backed settings** – Anchor mode (cursor or fixed) and position stored per profile.
- **Quick options** – `/insight` for anchor toggle, move, reset, and test.

## 🗺️ Vista (Minimap) - BETA

- **Cinematic square minimap** – Zone text, coordinates, instance difficulty, mail indicator, and button collector. Draggable, scalable, with optional auto-zoom.
- **Quick options** – `/mmm` for position reset, show/hide, and button collection.

## 🎨 Visuals & UI Design

- **High-fidelity icons** – Distinct icons for Campaign, Legendary, and World Quests.
- **Customizable colours** – Per-category colour control (title, objective, zone, section). Panel backdrop colour and opacity.
- **Scaling** – Global UI scale (50–200%) for all modules, or per-module sliders for Focus, Presence, Vista, Insight, and Yield when WoW UI scale is lowered.
- **Typography and spacing** – Fonts, sizes, outlines, and spacing sliders. Optional SharedMedia support for fonts from addon packs. Turn-in highlights and progress counts (e.g. 15/18) at a glance.
- **Progress bar** – Optional bar under objectives with numeric progress (e.g. 3/250). Configurable font, size, and colours.
- **Fluid motion** – Smooth entry/exit animations and a subtle pulse on objective completion.
- **Scroll indicators** – Optional fade or arrow buttons when the list has more content than visible.
