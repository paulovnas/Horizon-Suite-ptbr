## 4. Implementation notes

- All changes are `name`/`desc` strings only. `dbKey` values are untouched.
- Add `tooltip` field to option descriptors where the description table above has a non-"—" tooltip value.
- Add `OnEnter`/`OnLeave` tooltip support to toggle, slider, dropdown, color, and button widgets in `OptionsWidgets.lua`.
- Update `OptionsData_BuildSearchIndex` to concatenate `desc` and `tooltip` for search text.
- New or changed L[] keys need entries in frFR, koKR, ptBR, ruRU locale files (leave untranslated until translators update).
